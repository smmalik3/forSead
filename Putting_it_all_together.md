Setting up a subscription and role-based access system in WordPress involves several steps. You will utilize plugins and configurations to manage roles, subscriptions, and content access. Below is a guide to help you implement this on your WordPress site:

### Step-by-Step Setup:

#### 1. **Select and Install a Membership Plugin:**
   - **Recommended Plugins:** Choose a membership plugin that allows for role-based content access and subscription management. Popular options include:
     - **MemberPress**
     - **Restrict Content Pro**
     - **Paid Memberships Pro**
   - **Installation:** Go to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to `Plugins > Add New`, search for your chosen plugin, and install it.

#### 2. **Configure Membership Levels (Roles):**
   - After installing the plugin, create membership levels that map to the subscription plans and roles. Create a membership level for each detailed role like `teacher_sirah_grade_1`, `teacher_aqeedah_fiqh_ikhlaq_grade_1`, etc.
   - Each level should correspond to the specific program and grade access.

#### 3. **Set Up Subscription Plans:**
   - In the membership plugin, define pricing, billing intervals (e.g., monthly, yearly), and any trial periods.
   - Assign the appropriate WordPress role to each membership level:
     - For instance, the `teacher_sirah_grade_1` membership level could automatically assign the user to the corresponding role of the same name.

#### 4. **Protect Content:**
   - Set content access permissions so that only users with the appropriate role can access certain pages or posts. This typically involves setting content restrictions directly in the post/page editor or using settings from the membership plugin.
   - For each piece of content (e.g., Grade 1 manuals), restrict access based on the relevant membership levels.

#### 5. **Automatic Role Assignment:**
   - Most membership plugins will handle this automatically. When a user signs up for a subscription, their WordPress role should be set to the one defined for their membership level.

#### 6. **Create a Registration and Login System:**
   - Use your membership plugin to create a registration page where teachers can select and pay for their subscription plan.
   - Ensure you have a user-friendly login system that leads subscribers to their dashboard or profile page upon login.

#### 7. **Manage User Roles:**
   - Occasionally, you may need to manually adjust roles or manage users:
     - Navigate to `Users > All Users` in your WordPress dashboard to view and edit user roles as needed.

#### 8. **Implement Additional Functionality:**
   - **User Dashboard:** Create a custom dashboard page for subscribers where they can see their course access, manage their subscriptions, and update account information.
   - **Notifications and Emails:** Set up automated emails to notify users of changes to their subscriptions, upcoming renewals, or expiring access.

#### 9. **Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test the subscription process to ensure users are assigned the correct roles and can access content appropriately.
   - Test role changes, subscription cancellations, and renewals to ensure all functionalities work as expected.

#### 10. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Ensure your site is secure, especially regarding payment processing and personal data handling. Use SSL certificates and recommend services like Stripe or PayPal for secure payments.
   - Ensure compliance with relevant regulations such as GDPR if applicable.

### Additional Tools:
- **Role Editor Plugin:** Consider using a plugin like "User Role Editor" to easily customize and manage roles directly.
- **Content Dripping:** If you want to release content over time, see if your membership plugin supports content dripping.

Implementing these steps will allow you to create a robust system where teachers can access specific educational content according to their roles and subscriptions on your WordPress site.
