### Implementation Considerations:

- **Admin Role**: This role is crucial for overseeing site management, including user management, content updates, and system configurations. It should not be linked to a subscription but granted directly.
- **Role Assignment Based on Subscription**: When a user subscribes or changes their subscription, automatically update their role to match the new subscription type. This can be managed dynamically through your membership plugin or custom code.
- **Managing Roles and Access**: Configure your membership plugin or custom code to ensure that each role has the appropriate permissions only for the content and sections they need access to.

### Additional Recommendations:

- Consider a role for support or content moderation (`Support` or `Moderator`) if you anticipate the need to monitor user interactions or content effectively.
- Ensure there is a system for automatically deploying updates to roles and permissions when new subscription plans or content types are added. 

This approach allows each user to have a role that's directly tied to their subscription, making it easy to manage and scale access control.
